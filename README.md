Projects of the "Numerical simulation" course which I have taken on my third year of Bachelor degree.
The course is divided in 12 excercises. In the following lines I explain which arguments are discussed in each exercise.

1)Random Number Generators and Central Limit Theorem.
2)Monte Carlo integration, Importance sampling, Markov processes.
3)Black-Scholes Theory.
4)Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Verlet algorithm.
5)Metropolis algorithm.
6)The Ising model simulation: Metropolis and Gibbs sampling.
7)Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Metropolis algorithm.
8)Path Integral Monte Carlo:Imaginary time evolution.
9)Optimization: Genetic algorithms and Simulated annealing. 
10)Parallel computing: Message Passing Interface.
11)Feed-forward Neural Networks for supervised learning.
12)Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition.

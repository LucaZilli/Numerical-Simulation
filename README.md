### Numerical Simulations
Projects of the "Numerical simulation" course which I have taken on my third year of Bachelor degree.
The course is divided in 12 excercises. In the following lines I explain which arguments are discussed in each exercise:

1.Random Number Generators and Central Limit Theorem.
2.Monte Carlo integration, Importance sampling, Markov processes.
3.
4)Black-Scholes Theory.
5)Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Verlet algorithm.
6)Metropolis algorithm.
7)The Ising model simulation: Metropolis and Gibbs sampling.
8)Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Metropolis algorithm.
9)Path Integral Monte Carlo: Imaginary time evolution.
10)Optimization: Genetic algorithms and Simulated annealing. 
11)Parallel computing: Message Passing Interface.
12)Feed-forward Neural Networks for supervised learning.
13)Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition.
